* Please **DO NOT** use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KickStarterKits/BootstrapWebsiteKickStarter/issues) for personal support requests. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3966844/iamprogrammerlk) is a better places to get help. and or use [kuppiya.lk](http://www.kuppiya.lk/members/iamprogrammerlk.3614),[Geek.lk](http://geek.lk/profile/IamProgrammerlk) or [Elakiri.com](http://www.elakiri.com/forum/member.php?u=532627)

* Please **DO NOT** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **DO NOT** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

* Please **DO NOT** open issues or pull requests regarding the code in [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or  [JQuery](https://jquery.com) or [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org) (open them in their respective repositories).


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. **Validate and lint your code** &mdash; [validate your HTML](http://html5.validator.nu) and [lint your HTML](https://github.com/twbs/bootlint) to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example. [This JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/lefey/1/edit?html,output) is a helpful template.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome.

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, re-factoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](license.md).
